# Sample_Login_Page
A login/sign-up app created using firebase authentication and database backend with modern UI design.

## Installation
First clone the source code of this xcode proj to get access to main.storyboard creations and source-code of database
and authentication integration.

You can find instructions on cloning github projects here [cloning github projects](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)

Next if you havent already, set up an account with firebase [creating a firebase account](https://firebase.google.com/)

Information on setting up podfiles and google info-docs, aswell as connecting your app to firebase can be found here. [integrating firebase into your xcode project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)

Make sure to build the full project before doing any further work as small issues may arrise.

## Walkthrough
Initally you will be greeted with a login screen to prompt in your login details if an account has already been made..
If you have not made an account you can click the "Sign Up" button to be redirected to a seperate screen where you can fill in your login details.
Regex checks have been put in place to prevent weak passwords or incorrectly formatted emails being entered.
If you either sign up or login, you will be brough to a page where some of the details you have entered will be presented to you.

You can use this template to connect an already built login system to your app, as well as easily change styles etc to suit your needs.
